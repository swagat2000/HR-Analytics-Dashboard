The given dashboard presents an overview of employee attrition and various related metrics in an organization. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components:

#### 1. **Main KPIs**
   - **Employee Count**: 1,470
     - This represents the total number of employees in the organization.
   - **Attrition Count**: 237
     - The number of employees who left the organization.
   - **Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
     - The percentage of employees who left compared to the total employee count.
     - Formula: `(Attrition Count / Employee Count) * 100`
   - **Active Employees**: 1,233
     - The remaining employees after attrition is subtracted from the total count.
   - **Avg. Age**: 37
     - The average age of all employees.

#### 2. **Department-wise Attrition**
   - **HR (38.82%)**: 92 employees.
   - **R&D (5.06%)**: 12 employees.
   - **Sales (56.12%)**: 133 employees.
   - **Analysis**: The Sales department has the highest attrition (56.12%), indicating potential issues such as job dissatisfaction or market dynamics that require deeper investigation.

#### 3. **Number of Employees by Age Group**
   - The histogram displays the number of employees grouped by age brackets (bins of 3 years).
   - The highest concentration of employees is around the age of 30–36, with a peak in the 30–33 age group. This may indicate a mid-career workforce.
   - Employee count drops after the age of 39, indicating fewer employees in higher age brackets.

#### 4. **Job Satisfaction Rating**
   - The heatmap shows employee satisfaction levels (1 to 4) across different job roles:
     - **Sales Executives**: Highest dissatisfaction with 69 employees rating 1.
     - **Research Scientists**: Most satisfied with 90 employees rating 4.
   - **Analysis**: There is significant dissatisfaction in the Sales Executive role, with most employees rating their satisfaction level as 1 (lowest). This could be correlated with the high attrition rate in the Sales department.

#### 5. **Education Field-wise Attrition**
   - **Life Sciences (89 employees)**: The highest number of employees leaving from this field.
   - **Medical (63 employees)**: The second highest field of attrition.
   - **Analysis**: Different education fields experience varied attrition rates, with Life Sciences being the most impacted. It would be valuable to explore if job role alignment with educational background affects retention.

#### 6. **Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups**
   - **Under 25**:
     - Male: 38 employees (8.44%)
     - Female: 20 employees (4.22%)
   - **25-34**:
     - Male: 112 employees (29.11%)
     - Female: 69 employees (18.14%)
   - **35-44**:
     - Male: 51 employees (15.61%)
     - Female: 43 employees (5.91%)
   - **Analysis**: The age group 25-34 has the highest attrition for both males and females. Males in particular seem to have a higher attrition rate in every age group, which could indicate gender-specific concerns that the company might need to address.

#### 7. **Attrition by Gender**
   - **Female Attrition**: 87 employees.
   - **Male Attrition**: 150 employees.

#### Conclusion:
- **High Attrition in Sales**: The Sales department suffers from both the highest attrition rate and the lowest job satisfaction. This suggests that the company needs to focus on improving work conditions and employee satisfaction in this department.
- **Age Group Insights**: Most employees fall in the 30-36 age bracket. This may represent a workforce with experience, but the company should pay attention to attrition in the 25-34 age range, which is high across genders.
- **Job Satisfaction Trends**: Sales Executives are significantly less satisfied than Research Scientists, indicating a need for targeted interventions based on role-specific feedback.
- **Gender Disparity**: Attrition is higher for male employees, especially in certain age groups like 25-34. Addressing male-specific job satisfaction factors might reduce attrition.

### Outcomes:
1. **Investigate Sales Department**: Perform a deeper dive into the reasons for high attrition and low satisfaction in the Sales department, and consider interventions like training, role adjustments or incentives.
2. **Improve Work Environment for 25-34 Age Group**: Since this group has the highest attrition, introducing mentorship, career development opportunities, or flexible work arrangements might improve retention.
3. **Analyze Gender-based Concerns**: Address factors contributing to the higher attrition rate among male employees through surveys or interviews to understand their unique challenges and preferences.
4. **Job Role Satisfaction Programs**: For roles with low satisfaction like Sales Executive, consider job redesign or satisfaction improvement initiatives.
